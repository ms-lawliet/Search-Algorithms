# Data Structure and Algorithm Lab 5 Group exercises

Subject: Data Structures and Algorithms

Lab Activity: Search Algorithms

Objective: To implement and compare the performance of various search algorithms on different data sets.

## Instructions:

### Part 1: Implementing Search Algorithms

Implement all search algorithms in Python (code already provided) :

• Linear search

• Binary search

• Jump search

• Exponential search

• Interpolation search

• Ternary Search

Note: You can refer to the earlier explanations and the code provided for each algorithm to help you with the
implementation.

### Part 2: Generating Test Data

Create python code three different data sets for testing the search algorithms:

a. Small data set: Generate a sorted list of 100 integers.

b. Medium data set: Generate a sorted list of 1,000 integers.

c. Large data set: Generate a sorted list of 10,000 integers.

Choose a random target element from each data set to search for.

### Part 3: Testing and Comparing Search Algorithms

For each search algorithm, create a code to measure the time taken to find the target element in each
data set. A code has been given but you can change it to get a more efficient answer.

Record the execution times for each algorithm and data set combination.

### Part 4: Analysis and Conclusion

Create a table or graph to visualize the performance of each search algorithm on the different data sets.

Analyze the results and answer the following questions:

a. Which search algorithm performed the best overall?

b. Did any search algorithms perform better on specific data sets?

c. How did the size of the data set affect the performance of the search algorithms?

d. Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings
